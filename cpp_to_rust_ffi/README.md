Q3)
Description: Use FFI to call a C++ library from Rust. Please, create a simple C++ class with
methods and call these methods from Rust.

Skills: FFI, unsafe Rust, linking with C++ libraries, C++ name mangling.

Steps:
1. Write a simple C++ class/system that calculates
   (Please, take efficiency into consideration)
   a. Fibonacci numbers
   b. Lucas numbers
   c. Factorials
1. Compile it into a shared library.
1. Use Rust's FFI to call the C++ class methods.
1. Ensure the Rust code handles the C++ class interface correctly.
   Bonus: Add an end-point to calculate the digits of the Golden Ratio in terms of the Fibonacci
   sequence. Efficiently caching prior values may be helpful.
